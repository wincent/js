# Changes

## 0.0.2 (31 January 2019)

- `dedent()` can now be called as a regular function, in addition to the previous capability as a function for use as a tagged template literal. This functionality was actually intended to be included in the 0.0.1 release but a human error in the build process caused a stale build to be released. Safeguards against a repeat of this error have now been implemented.

## 0.0.1 (27 January 2019)

- Initial release.
